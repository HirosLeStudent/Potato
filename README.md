# Potato
Potato is a program that can fix unintentional double click on your mouse. 
It has the following features:
- Easy to use: Download and run Potato.exe from GitHub. No installation required!
- Light: Potato is only a few KB in size and does not consume much memory or CPU resources.
- Easy to stop: If you want to disable Potato, just press Shift+F4 on your keyboard. You can also exit it from the system tray icon.
- Completely open source: Potato is a AI generated Auto Hotkey script so nobody owned the source code, which means you can modify, distribute and use it for any purpose. You can find the source code on GitHub.
